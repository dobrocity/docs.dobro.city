# Leadership

By signing this document, we affirm our commitment to uphold the following principles, expressed as mutual expectations founded upon mutual trust. We agree to have our performance evaluated by fellow Leadership Team members according to these principles throughout the duration of the project.

1. **Autonomy:** I expect you to independently organize and execute your work without direct supervision or external management.
2. **Ownership:** I expect you to clearly demonstrate practical responsibility in maintaining, developing, and scaling your designated area of activity.
3. **Backbone:** I expect you to withstand peer pressure, especially in situations when we depend on your actions and decisions.
4. **Transparency:** I expect you to proactively inform colleagues about your current and planned activities, ensuring maximum visibility and understanding.
5. **Sincerity:** I expect consistent honesty and openness about your abilities and limitations, particularly regarding commitments and collaborative efforts.
