## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### **About the Project**  
**What is DoBro.City?**  
DoBro.City is a libertarian city project based on blockchain technologies and open-source developments. We create an innovative urban environment where decentralized technologies ensure transparency, security, and economic efficiency. We adhere to the principles of non-aggression and self-ownership.    

**What role does blockchain play in your city?**  
Blockchain is used to manage economic processes, including financial transactions, property rights notarization, and commitment articulation. This increases trust and eliminates centralized control.

**What does the open-source nature of the project mean?**  
We create an open codebase that allows all interested developers to participate in the project, propose improvements, and adapt solutions for other cities. You can fork any repository or the entire project in your physical location. 

**What specific city blockchain technologies do you offer?**  
We use the Stellar blockchain for tokenizing the real sector (Real World Assets - RWA) and participant commitments (labor tokens). We are not inventing a new blockchain. In Popup City, the blockchain acts as an automated ledger for recording economic transactions and property rights notarization. 

**What does Popup mean in the project name?**  
Popup implies a modular and flexible city architecture. This means the project can be temporary or adaptable, depending on the community's needs and location. Cities are such complex organizations that they cannot be planned. 

**Is DoBro.City tied to a specific location?**  
No, our concept is a universal framework that can be deployed in different locations. This allows for adapting solutions to the needs of various communities and economic conditions.  

**How can one join the project?**  
You can participate in the project by submitting Pull Requests on GitHub, reposting, and commenting on us on social networks (Telegram, Mastodon, Primal). We are also always open to collaboration with developers, urbanists, entrepreneurs, and blockchain technology enthusiasts. Write to [rinat](https://t.me/programyzer) with a greeting and an announcement of the contribution you want to make. 

**What social benefits does your project provide?**  
We create an environment where residents can actively participate in city management, take advantage of new digital economy opportunities, and live in a space free from excessive government control.  

**What advantages does the project have over traditional cities?**  
DoBro.City offers decentralized management, transparent city processes, reduced dependence on government structures, and innovative financial mechanisms for residents.  

**How does DoBro.City differ from similar projects, like Crypto Valley?**  
Crypto Valley in Switzerland is focused on a business ecosystem and regulatory mechanisms for blockchain companies. DoBro.City creates a holistic urban environment where blockchain technologies are integrated into the daily lives of citizens, providing decentralized management and an autonomous economy.
