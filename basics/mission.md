# Mission

The mission of the [dobro.city](https://dobro.city) project is the glorification of technological entrepreneurship and the increase of labor productivity through:

- Creation of temporary urban spaces for the development of entrepreneurial initiatives
- Deepening of labor division and professional development of participants
- Formation of a culture of respect for entrepreneurship
- Development of effective models of cooperation and exchange
- Promotion of the values of entrepreneurial thinking

## The Figure of the Entrepreneur

At the core of economic development lies the figure of the entrepreneurâ€”the main creator of real value in society. It is the entrepreneur, risking their own resources and reputation, who organizes the production of goods and services, creates jobs, and pays taxes, through which all other members of society exist. Employees receive salaries thanks to entrepreneurial activity, public servants live on taxes collected from businesses, and investors earn interest on their invested capital. Therefore, supporting and developing entrepreneurial initiatives is a key task for the sustainable development of any territory.

## The Distinction of the Entrepreneur

It is important to distinguish the technological entrepreneur from other participants in economic activities. He is not a trader who profits from price differences in different markets and times. He is not a capitalist living on interest from invested funds. And he is not a politician who exists on the redistribution of tax revenues. A technological entrepreneur is a creator of new products and services who takes on the risk of developing innovative solutions, forms new markets, and creates additional value for society by addressing weaknesses in systems of labor division and implementing technologies.

## Value Actualization

The entrepreneur is a key figure in the process of actualizing new values in society. It is he, being at the forefront of technological development, who first sees opportunities to create new products and services that can satisfy needs that have not yet been recognized. Through his activities, the entrepreneur not only responds to existing demand but actively forms new markets, creates jobs for new specializations and competencies, and implements innovative technologies into production processes. In doing so, he continuously expands the boundaries of the possible, actualizes potential values into real ones, and serves as the main driver of societal progress.

## Conclusion

Thus, the mission of [dobro.city](https://dobro.city) is not to independently determine which values should be actualized and implemented in society. Our task is to create favorable conditions and an effective infrastructure for technological entrepreneurs so that they can respond to these fundamental questions through their concrete actions by creating innovative products and services. We believe that it is the entrepreneurs, being at the forefront of technological development and taking on risks, who are most capable of effectively determining and bringing to life those values that are truly important to society. In this process, the [dobro.city](https://dobro.city) project itself acts as an entrepreneur.
